   This is where we are supposed to explain in detail the specifications of our chosen plots and why they were selected for scientific exploration. Unfortunately, I was unable to complete everything to my satisfaction and, therefore, have nothing here to show.
   I would imagine that I would have chosen a few plots of interest with a variety about them that would be sufficient enough to show off the far spanning flexibility of the code I have written. There would have been variants of each plot to indicate that I not only can produce a generic output but I can also manipulate and interpret the data to ensure adequate exploration were accomplished. Lengthy detail and examples would have been given to round everything out with completeness and fullness to assure anyone who were to examine the scientific exploration could follow along with basic understanding. Finally, I would have done my best to create an amalgam of work that shows off my scientific/technical background formatted in an easy to read and user friendly report.
